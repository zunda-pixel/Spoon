# Spoon

An AI-first git client for macOS, built with SwiftUI for macOS 27 (Golden Gate).

## Features

- **Changes** — files shown as a directory tree (collapsible, single-child
  chains folded). Stage / unstage whole files, hunks, or individually
  selected lines — in both directions (line-level unstage on staged diffs).
  Multi-select with ⌘/⇧, double-click or press Return to move files, drag &
  drop between areas, discard selected lines, right-click to open a file or
  reveal it in Finder.
- **History** — commit graph with infinite scroll; commit details show the
  full patch with selectable, copyable lines.
- **Interactive rebase** — pick / squash / drop / edit with drag-to-reorder,
  from a commit's context menu; plus cherry-pick and revert. Conflicts and
  edit stops show a banner with Continue / Skip / Abort.
- **Branches** — create (from HEAD or any branch), delete, rename, and check
  out branches (or any commit, detached); merge or squash-merge a branch
  into the current one; check out a remote branch as a local tracking
  branch; link a branch to its own worktree (add / open in a new window /
  remove).
- **Tags** — list in the sidebar, tag any commit (lightweight or annotated),
  delete.
- **Stashes** — save (including untracked files), browse a stash's diff,
  apply, pop, or drop it.
- **Clone** — clone over https / ssh from the Welcome screen with live
  progress.
- **Pull requests** — branches display their open GitHub PR with review and
  CI status; a PR list and detail view come from the GitHub GraphQL API.
- **AI** — generate commit messages and review branches with Claude Code or
  Codex, running the CLIs you already have installed.
- **Shortcuts** — App Intents for “Open Repository” and “Stash Changes”.
- Auto-refresh via FSEvents, repository-titled windows and tabs.

## Git features not in Spoon (yet)

Spoon shells out to your system `git` and covers everyday client workflows. The
items below exist in **modern Git** (including recent 2.4x–2.55 releases) but
are **not exposed** in Spoon’s UI or `GitClient` API today.

### Repository & remotes

- **Sparse checkout** — `sparse-checkout` / cone mode
- **Submodule clone** — `--recurse-submodules` at clone time
- **Edit remote URL** — `git remote set-url` (add/remove only today)
- **`git backfill`** (2.49+) — fetch missing blobs in partial clones

### History & inspection

- **Reflog** — recover “lost” commits and branch tips
- **Blame** — `git blame` / annotate lines in a file
- **File history** — `git log -- <path>` as a dedicated view
- **Bisect** — binary search for the commit that introduced a bug
- **Range diff** — `git range-diff`, including `--remerge-diff` (2.48+)

### Commits & history editing

- **Reset** — `git reset` (soft / mixed / hard)
- **Interactive rebase: reword & fixup** — Spoon supports pick, squash, drop, and
  edit only; reword/fixup are omitted until message-editing UI exists
- **`git history reword` / `git history split`** (2.54+, experimental) — simpler
  history edits without a full interactive rebase
- **`git replay`** (experimental) — replay commits onto a new base without
  touching the working tree

### Merge, push & conflicts

- **Built-in 3-way merge resolver** — Spoon detects conflicts and can mark files
  resolved by staging; there is no inline merge editor or `git mergetool` UI
- **Push tags** — create/delete locally; no push-to-remote for tags

### Signing & integrity

- **GPG / SSH commit signing** — `-S`, `commit.gpgsign`, signed-tag workflows
- **Signed-tag verification** — beyond listing tag names

### Large repos & storage

- **Git LFS** — `git lfs` track/fetch/push
- **Submodules** — init/update/status in nested repos
- **Reftable backend** (2.45+) — `init --ref-format=reftable`, `refs migrate`
- **`git maintenance`** — configure geometric repack and other maintenance tasks
- **`git repo info` / `git repo structure`** (2.52+) — repository size and layout
  diagnostics

### Diffs & workflows

- **Image diffs** and **side-by-side diff** views
- **Git-flow** — branch naming / release/hotfix helpers
- **Hooks editor** — hooks may run when you commit; Spoon does not manage them
  (Git 2.54+ also supports hooks defined in config)
- **Git config UI** — no in-app editor for repo/user gitconfig (tool-path
  overrides exist internally but are not wired to Settings yet)

## Requirements

- macOS 27 (Golden Gate) or later
- `git` (Xcode Command Line Tools are enough)
- Optional, for the matching features:
  - [`gh`](https://cli.github.com) — GitHub authentication for PR sync
  - [`claude`](https://claude.com/claude-code) and/or `codex` — AI commit
    messages and reviews

## Building

Open `Spoon.xcodeproj` with Xcode 27 and run the **Spoon** scheme.
