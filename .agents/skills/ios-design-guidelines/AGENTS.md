## Never Do

- Never use hamburger menus — use a tab bar
- Never override swipe-from-left-edge back navigation
- Never hardcode text sizes — support Dynamic Type
- Never use only color to convey information
- Never request all permissions at launch
- Never place primary actions at the top of the screen (outside thumb zone)
- Never clip content under the status bar, home indicator, or Dynamic Island
- Never use blocking spinner overlays for loading states
- Never show splash screen logos — match the first screen of the app
- Never hide the tab bar during navigation within a tab
